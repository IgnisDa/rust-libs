# Arch Mirrors

Parse the Arch Linux mirror status

## Description

The `arch-mirrors-rs` crate allows you to parse the JSON different mirror status 
sources (like https://www.archlinux.org/mirrors/status/json) into a typed, 
rusty form. 

## Examples

For the examples see [examples](examples).

## Installation

```bash
$ cargo add arch-mirrors-rs
```

# Acknowledgements

Most of the code is directly taken from
[arch-mirrors](https://github.com/ALinuxPerson/arch-mirrors). I made some PRs
there but they went unanswered, so I had to fork it.
